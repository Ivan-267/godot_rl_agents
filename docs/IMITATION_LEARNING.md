# Imitation Learning

For imitation learning, we use the imitation library: https://github.com/HumanCompatibleAI/imitation

From the docs:
> Imitation provides clean implementations of imitation and reward learning algorithms, under a unified and user-friendly API. Currently, we have implementations of Behavioral Cloning, DAgger (with synthetic examples), density-based reward modeling, Maximum Causal Entropy Inverse Reinforcement Learning, Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning, Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning, and Deep RL from Human Preferences.
