# Working with C#

While the Godot RL Agents Godot plugin currently natively supports only working with gdscript and this option is recommended, 
it is possible to use C# for your projects as well. The process is slightly more complicated, so some understanding of
how the gdscript variant of the plugin works is recommended.

We recommended completing the [custom env](https://github.com/edbeeching/godot_rl_agents/blob/main/docs/CUSTOM_ENV.md) tutorial first using
gdscript to get an idea of the usual process with gdscript first.

We have prepared a simple example that comes in 3 variants:
- GDScript [TODO: LINK] (the entire game is written in gdscript)
- CSharp [TODO: LINK] (most of the game is written in C#, except for the extended AIController which is written in GDScript)
- CSharpAll [TODO: LINK] (the game is written in C#, and an AIController wrapper is written in C# as well)

A brief comparison of the two C# approaches:
### CSharp
### CSharpAll
